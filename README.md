     	'dir'        => 'path/to/data/dir',
        'dbname'      => 'monodb0',
        'key_length'  => 50,
        'blob_size'   => 5000000,
        'key_expiry'  => 0,
        'perm_dir'    => 0755,
        'perm_file'   => 0644
    ]
);

```

Name|Type|Default Value|Description
:---|:---|:---|:---
`dir`|string|<temp-dir\>/\_monodb\_|The directory where the database are stored.
`dbname`|string|db0|The directory where the data files are stored.
`key_length`|int|50|Maximum key length. Larger than this will truncated.
